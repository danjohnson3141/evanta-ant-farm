# Gartner C-level Communities Ant Farm

See all the busy busy devs making anthills of code.

### github pages link:
https://danjohnson3141.github.io/evanta-ant-farm/

### Locally:
`npm install && npm run build && npm start`

Inspired by https://github.com/MeoMix/antfarm

### TODOs:
* Make only one ant for each name in names.json
* Have the ants randomly say funny things. Perhaps the text mapped to the name? i.e. Ryan's Ghost would say "host of meetings".
* Make ants a little bigger

### Packages:
